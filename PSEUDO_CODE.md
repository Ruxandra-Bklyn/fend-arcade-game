# Pseudo code

The different steps needed to create the game starting from the provided code.

## Classes to write

- Player (character controlled by the player to move and reach the exit)
- Enemy (the computer-controlled character which cross the screen and collide with the payer)
- Collectible (The item the player must take to have additional points)
- Shield (An extra power to collect and which prevent the next collision)

## Class properties and functions

## Project Rubric
- [ ] The game functions correctly and runs error free
- [ ] Player can not move off screen
- [ ] Vehicles cross the screen
- [ ] Vehicle-player collisions happen logically (not too early or too late)
- [ ] Vehicle-player collision resets the game
- [ ] Something happens when player wins
- [ ] Game objects (player and vehicles) are implemented using JavaScript object-oriented programming features
- [ ] A README file is included detailing all steps required to successfully run the application
- [ ] Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedures. As a rule of thumb: describe what all custom functions and object methods do
- [ ] Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting as described in the [Udacity JavaScript Style Guide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/javascript.html)
