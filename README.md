# FRONT-END NANODEGREE: PROJECT ARCADE GAME

This project is a part of the Front-End Development Nanodegree program with Udacity.

The goal is to develop a Frogger-like game using Object-Oriented JavaScript.

## Get Started

### To play

- Open the **index.html** file
- Choose your **character** by clicking on its image
- **Start** the game by pressing the _START_ button
- You stand now on your **initial position**
- The **goal** is to reach the last row of the game (the one on the top)
- Use the **up**, **down**, **left**, **right** arrow keys of the keyboard to move your character accordingly
- You must **avoid the enemies** or you would go back to your initial position
- **Have fun!**

### To develop

- Load the game by opening _index.html_
- Find all the styling in _css/style.css_
- The files _js/engine.js_ and _js/resources.js_ managed the game loop
- The functions are written in the _js/app.js_ file
- The game is coded in **Object-Oriented Vanilla JavaScript**
